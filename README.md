h1. Grails MongoDB Console
This project intend to provide a grails plugin similar to the grails-dbconsole plugin but for MongoDB.
It will uses some of the latest technologies in JS/HTML5 to provide a powerful and ergonomic Web GUI (well, that's the goal at least).

The plugin does not require the official mongodb-gorm plugin to work, but it will use the configured mongo bean if the plugin is installed in your project.

For the UI we're currently using :
* Angular JS 1.1.0
* ACE web text editor
* Twitter Bootstrap-based templates

Please note that the project is at its early stage and is not yet actually usable,
but you're welcome to evaluate the plugin and maybe make some feedback :)
