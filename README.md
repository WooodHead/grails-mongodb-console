# Grails MongoDB Console
This project intend to provide a grails plugin similar to the grails-dbconsole plugin but for MongoDB, built on the Groovy mongodb driver.
It will uses some of the latest technologies in JS/HTML5 to provide a powerful and ergonomic Web GUI (well, that's the goal at least) that will allow you to :
* Browse through the documents of any collection
* Create, remove or update any document
* Browse through any GridFS buckets with a dedicated UI, allowing upload, download and deletion of files
* Querying the DB using the JSON / TenGen syntax, or using a simplified Lucene-query-like string for simple queries
* View all the administrative stuffs, isMaster, serverStatus, replicasets, ...
* _[this list will expand with time, I guess]_

Please note that the project is at its early stage and is not yet actually usable, not all of the listed features are available yet,
but feel free to evaluate the plugin and maybe write some feedback :)

## UI Technologies
For the UI we're currently using :
* Angular JS 1.1.0
* ACE web text editor
* Twitter Bootstrap-based templates

## Supported Browsers
The current dev is tested on the latest Chrome & Firefox stable releases.
A few glitches are known to happen on IE9, but we will fix them eventually.

Compatibility with older browsers are not the current priority.

## Installation
The plugin isn't available yet on the official Grails plugin repository so you can't pull the dependencies directly, we will add a first version of the plugin when
the basic features are covered.

The plugin does not require the official mongodb-gorm plugin in order to work, but it will use the configured mongo bean if the plugin is installed in your project.
In any case, it pulls the mongodb and GMongo dependencies to work with mongodb. If you already have these but with different versions, you can exclude them from your ``BuildConfig.groovy``
when you pull the plugin dependency.
Please do note that the aggregrate framework manipulation is not available in GMongo in versions anterior to the 1.0.

For now, you can clone the git repository, then run ``grails run-app`` and navigate to ``<root-project-name>/mviewer``.
A running MongoDB instance is required (the plugin connects on localhost:27017 by default). Configurable host/port will come later.
